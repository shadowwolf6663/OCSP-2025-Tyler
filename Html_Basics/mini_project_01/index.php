echo "<p>The story begins with Ken Kaneki as an ordinary college student who is fascinated with books. After an encounter with a mysterious woman named Rize, Kaneki nearly dies when she reveals herself as a ghoul and attempts to eat him. He survives the attack after falling steel beams injure Rize, and he receives an emergency transplant of her organs, turning him into the first artificial one-eyed ghoul. Forced to consume human flesh, Kaneki struggles to accept his new, gruesome reality. He is taken in by the ghouls who run the coffee shop Anteiku, and they teach him how to navigate his new life. Captured and brutally tortured by the ghoul Yamori, Kaneki reaches a breaking point. During this psychological shift, he accepts his ghoul side and gains the strength needed to protect his friends. Following the ordeal, his hair turns white, symbolizing his transformation and rejection of his former, timid self.</p>"; // information on season

echo "<p>In the anime's original storyline, Kaneki makes the drastic decision to abandon his friends at Anteiku and joins the ruthless Aogiri Tree to grow stronger. Within this ghoul organization, he becomes more violent and ruthless, earning the nickname -Centipede- due to his unique, centipede-like kagune. He cannibalizes other ghouls to increase his power, losing more of his humanity in the process. The season culminates in a massive raid by the CCG (the human anti-ghoul organization) on Anteiku. Kaneki fights alongside his ghoul comrades, but the tragedy deepens when he is left carrying the mortally wounded body of his human friend, Hide. The strongest CCG investigator, Kisho Arima, then confronts and defeats Kaneki. The season ends with Kaneki suffering amnesia, his identity completely wiped from his memory.</p>";  // information on season

echo "<h2>season 3</h2>";// sub heading
echo "<p>Two years later, Kaneki reappears as Haise Sasaki, a Ghoul Investigator for the CCG, with no memory of his past. His hair is now a blend of black and white. Haise mentors the Quinx Squad, a team of human investigators implanted with ghoul abilities. However, fragments of his past start to resurface as he battles ghouls, causing him intense internal conflict. During a mission, his memories fully return, and his hair turns completely black, signaling his complete identity shift. Now known as the -Black Reaper- within the CCG, Kaneki becomes more brutal and cold in combat. He eventually breaks from the CCG to free Hinami from a ghoul prison, leading to a fight against Arima, his former CCG mentor. Kaneki defeats Arima, who then commits suicide after revealing his secret past and entrusting Kaneki with the role of the -One-Eyed King-.</p>"; // information on season
